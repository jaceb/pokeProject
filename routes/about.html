  Hi! I'm Jace.<br> <br> For some context, to the left is a picture from when I competed at the Pacific Northwest Regional Yoyo Contest in 2016.  I am a full stack developer who moonlights as a sponsored yoyo player.
  <br><br> I have experience using HTML as well as CSS, Javascript, JQuery and Angular Javascript.
